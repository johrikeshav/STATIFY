# STATIFY

## WHERE MUSIC MEETS MACHINE LEARNING

Statify is a website, allowing one to view their spotify usage statistics, and to see how much a certain track aligns with their top tracks. Future plans include me wanting to add an auto login feature, since the current spotify API doesnt allow anyone to login, only those who have been manually logged in by the developer. Future plans include either updating this readme to properly explain how to use this tool, or to bypass the restriction entirely somehow. For now, I have uploaded a demo video showcasing the working.
